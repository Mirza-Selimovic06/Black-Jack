# Black-Jack
A Console C++ black jack game
A player will get a two cards and so will the computer
The player has a choice to hit or stand
A hit will add one more card and add the total of all three cards
If the players total points (the sum of all three cards) is greater than the house then the player wins
If the player has a sum of over 21 then its a bust and they lose.
A stand will not add a card
